# Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS) projects (2018 spring)
University related projects written in C and JAVA which main goal is to familiarize with well known data structures/algorithms by creating or implementing them.

## Skills acquired after working with ADS tasks:

- Usage of algorithms when completing specific tasks.
- Creating a functional abstract data type such as big integer while utilising linked lists. It can do 4 basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide.
- Implementing priority queue and big integer to simulate queued plane arrival with only 1 available track.
- Creating a predefined graph data structure and using depth first search to complete specific tasks.
- General understanding of how and when to use specific data structures and algorithms.
